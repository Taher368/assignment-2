Hi there,
This a node backend project. In this project I use express mongoose and typescript. For validation my schemas I used Zod validations.
some steps you need to do to run my project.
step-1: clone git hub repo
step-2:cd project repo name
step-3: open terminal and run this command => npm install
step-4: run command => npm run start:dev
note: Don't forget modify env variables. 
thanks!!!
